//! End-to-end orchestrator for `anolisa disable <capability>` (P1-I).
//!
//! **Scope.** Disable flips the capability object — and every component
//! listed in its `component_refs` — to `ObjectStatus::Disabled`, runs the
//! disable lifecycle hooks that are strict or best-effort by phase, stops
//! owned service units on a best-effort basis, and writes matching
//! `started` / `succeeded` records to the central log. It does NOT:
//!
//!   * delete files (`OwnedFile` paths stay on disk);
//!   * `systemctl disable` service units or remove unit files;
//!   * touch the distribution-index, the download cache, or the install
//!     runner;
//!   * take a backup or build a transaction frame.
//!
//! Full teardown (file removal, service disablement, external-config
//! rollback, and transaction-framed purge) is handled by uninstall/purge
//! paths rather than this logical disable surface.
//!
//! This module mirrors the lock / log / state sequencing of
//! [`crate::enable_execute::execute_enable`] but is much smaller: there is
//! no per-component IO loop because there are no side effects to perform.
//!
//! Sequence on the success path:
//!
//!   1. Best-effort pre-lock check that the capability exists. This is
//!      advisory: a typo short-circuits with `CapabilityNotInstalled`
//!      and **no audit-log noise**, but the authoritative read happens
//!      inside the lock at step 3 so a concurrent disable / uninstall
//!      cannot smuggle the wrong `was_disabled` / `component_refs` past
//!      us.
//!   2. Acquire the install lock (`state_dir/lock`).
//!   3. **Inside the lock**, load `installed.toml` and compute the
//!      authoritative `previous_status`, `was_disabled`, and
//!      `component_refs`. If the capability vanished between step 1 and
//!      step 3, fail with `CapabilityNotInstalled` and **still write
//!      nothing** to the central log — symmetric with the pre-lock
//!      typo path so a concurrent uninstaller does not produce
//!      ghost audit entries.
//!   4. Append the `started` record to the central log.
//!   5. Run strict `pre_disable` hooks before the state flip. A hard
//!      failure records `failed` and leaves state unchanged.
//!   6. Snapshot `installed.toml` bytes; mutate the in-memory state
//!      (`status = Disabled`, `last_operation_id = <op>`) for the
//!      capability + each referenced component; append an
//!      `OperationRecord { status = "ok" }`; `state.save`. Any failure
//!      after the snapshot restores the prior bytes (or removes the file
//!      if there was no prior).
//!   7. Append the `succeeded` record; release the lock.
//!   8. Stop owned service units best-effort, then run best-effort
//!      `post_disable` hooks. Failures after the state flip surface as
//!      warnings rather than reverting the disable.
//!
//! Idempotency: if the capability is already `Disabled` at step 3, we
//! still go through lock + `started` + `succeeded` (so the audit trail
//! records the request was received) but we do NOT mutate state and do
//! NOT append an `OperationRecord`. The outcome carries `changed:
//! false` so callers can suppress downstream side effects. Because
//! `was_disabled` is sampled inside the lock, the second of two
//! back-to-back disable calls always lands here even if the first call
//! finished microseconds earlier — `disable_second_sequential_call_sees_disabled_and_writes_no_operation_record`
//! pins the contract.
