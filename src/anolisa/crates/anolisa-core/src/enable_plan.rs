//! `enable --dry-run` plan contract.
//!
//! [`plan_enable`] is a pure, side-effect-free function that takes a
//! catalog snapshot, distribution index, environment facts, install-mode
//! string, and a capability name and returns an [`EnablePlan`] describing
//! what `anolisa enable <cap>` *would* do. It does NOT touch the
//! filesystem, write state, download artifacts, or modify any service —
//! the plan is data only.
//!
//! Status vocabulary (`PlanStatus`):
//!
//! * `Ready` - every precheck passed and an artifact resolved for every
//!   component.
//! * `Degraded` - at least one non-fatal warning (e.g. version drift, an
//!   optional probe is unknown). The plan can still execute.
//! * `Blocked` - at least one blocker: env mismatch, missing component
//!   manifest, install-mode unsupported, no matching artifact. The plan
//!   cannot execute as-is.
//!
//! `PlanError` is reserved for inputs that prevent us from producing any
//! plan at all — currently only an unknown capability name. Everything
//! else surfaces inside the plan via per-check / per-component status.
