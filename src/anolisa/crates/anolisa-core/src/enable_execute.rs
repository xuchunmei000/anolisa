//! End-to-end orchestrator for `anolisa enable <capability>`.
//!
//! Given an already-built [`EnablePlan`] and a resolved [`FsLayout`],
//! [`execute_enable`] performs the minimal real install sequence:
//!
//!   1. acquire the advisory install lock;
//!   2. append a `started` audit record to the central log;
//!   3. for each component: download the artifact to the cache, then
//!      install it under the ANOLISA-owned layout;
//!   4. persist the operation outcome to `installed.toml`;
//!   5. append a `succeeded` audit record and release the lock.
//!
//! Any failure in steps 4 onwards (and any failure during a per-component
//! download/install) triggers cleanup: ANOLISA-owned files installed by
//! this operation are unlinked, a `failed` audit record is appended best
//! effort, and the lock is released. The CLI wrapper (Sub-D) renders the
//! returned [`ExecuteOutcome`] or [`ExecuteError`] to the user.
